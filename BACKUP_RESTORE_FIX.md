# Backup & Restore Fix - Complete Data Restoration

## Issue Fixed
The backup/restore functionality has been enhanced to ensure **ALL data is properly backed up and restored** across all database tables and columns.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Checkpoint**
- **Problem**: SQLite uses WAL mode where data can be split between the main database file (.db) and the WAL file (.db-wal). If the WAL isn't checkpointed before backup, some data might be missing.
- **Solution**: Added automatic WAL checkpoint before creating backups to consolidate all data into the main database file.

### 2. **Database Integrity Verification**
- **Problem**: No verification was performed after restore to ensure data was correctly restored.
- **Solution**: Added automatic integrity checks and data verification after restore.

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added detailed logging throughout the backup/restore process to track what's being backed up and restored.

## Technical Changes

### In `/app/app/api/backup/route.js`:
```javascript
// Before backup, checkpoint the WAL to ensure all data is in the main DB file
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
const db = new Database(dbPath);

// This is the critical fix - consolidates all data
db.pragma('wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)');
db.close();
```

### In `/app/app/api/restore/route.js`:
```javascript
// After restore, verify database integrity
const restoredDb = new Database(dbPath);

// Checkpoint to ensure data is properly loaded
restoredDb.pragma('wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)');

// Verify integrity
const integrityCheck = restoredDb.pragma('integrity_check');
if (integrityCheck[0].integrity_check === 'ok') {
  console.log('✅ Database integrity verified');
}

restoredDb.close();
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Backup Process**:
   - Checkpoint WAL → All data consolidated to main .db file
   - Create backup archive with database + upload files
   - No data is left behind in WAL files

2. **Restore Process**:
   - Extract backup files
   - Replace current database
   - Checkpoint restored database
   - Verify integrity
   - Confirm all tables and data are present

## Database Tables Covered

All 23 tables are fully backed up and restored:
- ✅ staff_records
- ✅ teachers
- ✅ teacher_info
- ✅ employee_leaves
- ✅ officer_leaves
- ✅ calendar_entries
- ✅ activities
- ✅ exam_supervision
- ✅ supervision
- ✅ bus_records
- ✅ payroll
- ✅ installments
- ✅ monthly_expenses
- ✅ building_expenses
- ✅ daily_accounts
- ✅ kitchen_expenses
- ✅ student_permissions
- ✅ supervised_students
- ✅ legend_entries
- ✅ email_settings
- ✅ email_tasks
- ✅ user_profiles
- ✅ security_logs

## Data Types Preserved

All column data types are correctly preserved:
- ✅ TEXT columns
- ✅ REAL (numeric) columns
- ✅ INTEGER columns
- ✅ JSON data columns (for flexible schema tables)
- ✅ Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

## Flexible Schema Tables

Special handling for tables with flexible schema (data stored as JSON):
- employee_leaves
- officer_leaves
- supervision
- student_permissions
- supervised_students

These tables store data in a `data` column as JSON, and the fix ensures the JSON is properly backed up and restored without data loss.

## Testing

To verify your backup/restore is working correctly:

1. **Create test data** in various sections
2. **Create a backup** using the backup button
3. **Delete some data** (optional, for testing)
4. **Restore the backup**
5. **Verify all data is back** - check all sections

You can also run the verification script:
```bash
node scripts/verify_backup_restore.js
```

## What to Check After Restore

After restoring a backup, verify:
- [ ] All records in each section are present
- [ ] Data appears in the correct columns
- [ ] No duplicate records
- [ ] Images and files are restored
- [ ] Dates and numbers are correct

## Logging

Check the browser console or server logs for detailed information:
- "✅ WAL checkpointed successfully" - Backup ready
- "✅ Database integrity verified" - Restore successful
- "✅ Restored database contains X tables" - All tables restored

## Notes

- The fix is backward compatible with existing backups
- Backups now include metadata about when they were created
- Both `.db` file and associated files (.db-wal, .db-shm) are handled correctly
- Upload directory (images/videos) is also backed up and restored
