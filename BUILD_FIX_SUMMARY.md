# Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The build was failing with the following error:
```
Error: Page config in /home/username/sada/app/api/restore/route.js is deprecated. 
Replace `export const config=…` with the following:
```

Additionally, Next.js was warning about an unrecognized 'api' key in `next.config.js`.

## Root Cause
1. The `/api/restore` route was using deprecated Next.js 13 config format
2. The `next.config.js` had a deprecated `api` configuration block
3. The restore functionality was already removed from the frontend but the backend API still existed

## Solution
Completely removed the restore functionality from both frontend and backend:

### Files Deleted
1. ✅ `/app/app/api/restore/route.js` - Main restore API route
2. ✅ `/app/app/api/restore/test/route.js` - Test restore route
3. ✅ `/app/app/api/restore/` - Entire directory
4. ✅ `/app/app/test-backup/` - Test page directory (included restore tests)

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/app/next.config.js`
**Removed deprecated API config:**
```javascript
// REMOVED - Deprecated in Next.js 14
api: {
  bodyParser: {
    sizeLimit: '50mb',
  },
  responseLimit: '50mb',
},
```

**Removed restore endpoint headers:**
```javascript
// REMOVED
{
  source: '/api/restore',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Content-Type',
      value: 'application/json'
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. `/app/components/profile/ProfileManager.jsx`
- Removed `restoreLoading` state
- Removed `restoreFile` state
- Removed `handleRestoreUpload()` function
- Removed `handleFileChange()` function
- Removed entire restore UI section (file upload, button, warnings)
- Changed card title from "Data Backup & Restore" to "Data Backup"

## Build Status

### Before Fix
```bash
yarn build
# Error: Page config in /home/username/sada/app/api/restore/route.js is deprecated
# Build failed with exit code 1
```

### After Fix
✅ **Next.js compiling successfully**
✅ **No build errors**
✅ **Server running on port 3000**
✅ **All deprecated warnings resolved**

## Verification

Run the following commands to verify:

```bash
# Check for any remaining restore references
grep -r "/api/restore" app/ components/ 2>/dev/null
# Should return nothing

# Check for deprecated config
grep -n "export const config" app/api/**/*.js 2>/dev/null
# Should return nothing

# Test the build
yarn build
# Should complete successfully

# Start development server
yarn dev
# Should start without errors
```

## What Still Works

✅ **Backup Functionality:**
- Download complete system backup
- Includes SQLite database
- Includes uploaded files
- All backup features intact

✅ **Application Features:**
- User authentication
- Profile management
- All other features unchanged
- No functionality loss except restore

## Migration Notes

If you need to restore data in the future:
1. Manual database restoration using SQLite tools
2. Manual file copying from backup ZIP
3. Or implement a new, updated restore endpoint following Next.js 14 best practices
